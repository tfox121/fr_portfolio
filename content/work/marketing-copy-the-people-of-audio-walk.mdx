*An extraordinary walk, through familiar streets.*

**The people of** is an audio walk that creates a fleeting portrait of an ordinary high street. Just two miles from Manchester city centre, Northmoor Road in Longsight is a meeting and crossing point for all sorts of different people.

This intimate audio walk guides you along a well-trodden route, past the greengrocer, the barber’s, the butcher and the takeaways. As life carries on around you, tune into the voices of the people who keep this place alive. 

*The greengrocer who used to keep pigeons in Pakistan, the cleaner who grows sunflowers on her balcony, the auto electrician who is learning on the job, the tour guide who plays his saxophone in the local park, the person living on the 15th floor with a bird’s eye view of it all…*

**The people of** is created from a fascination with how we live together – how our daily lives depend on, and collide with, those we don’t really know. It looks at the journeys that we take, how we spend our time, and what it really means to live together.

The latest work by Manchester ensemble [Quarantine](https://www.qtine.com/home), **The people of** is made through interviews and encounters with the people who live and work in the area. It maps the voices, stories and daily routines of Northmoor Road against a sonic landscape of found and composed sound, transforming the street into a live exhibition of people.
