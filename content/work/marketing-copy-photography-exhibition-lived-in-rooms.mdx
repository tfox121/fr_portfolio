*From June Street to Irwell Riverside - a photographic dialogue on home, city living and portraiture.*

In 1973, Daniel Meadows and Martin Parr photographed the residents of June Street in Salford, documenting them in the front rooms of their homes, just months before their red-brick terraced houses were demolished. In 2018, 1.5 miles away, the white and grey modular terraces of Irwell Riverside were completed, and the first residents moved in.

In a homage and a redux of the June Street series, Gavin Parry has photographed the residents of Irwell Riverside in their homes. From June Street demolition to Irwell Riverside redevelopment, this exhibition reflects 50 years of political, social and technological changes that have reshaped the terraced street and city living.

Lived-In Rooms exhibits Gavin Parryâ€™s photographs publicly for the first time, side by side with the June Street series, on site in a house in the new Irwell Riverside development, which sits on the border of Manchester and Salford, a ten-minute walk from Manchester City Centre.
