*Nice to meet you. What do you do?*

*12 Last Songs* is about work.

Making a living. Finding your passion. Watching the clock. 

This extraordinary new durational performance piece constructs a fleeting portrait of society. There are no actors. It’s a live exhibition of people, an epic performance that casts the steady rhythms of life on a carnival scale. 

Over the course of a day, workers will do shifts. A bricklayer might build a wall, a hairdresser might cut someone’s hair, a chef might prepare a meal…  

Directed by Richard Gregory, 12 Last Songs premiered with Transform 21-22 at Leeds Playhouse in Autumn 2021.
